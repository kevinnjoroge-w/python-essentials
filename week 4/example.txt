Python Data Structures Grouped by Mutability
Mutable Data Structures
These data structures can be modified after their creation, allowing changes to their contents or state:

Lists: Ordered collections of elements that can be added, removed, or updated.

Dictionaries: Key-value pairs that can be modified by adding, updating, or deleting keys and values.

Sets: Unordered collections of unique elements that can be updated by adding or removing elements.

Arrays (from array module): Typed sequences of elements that can be updated.

Immutable Data Structures
These data structures cannot be changed once created. Any modification results in the creation of a new instance:

Tuples: Ordered collections of elements that cannot be modified after creation.

Strings: Sequences of characters that are immutable.

Frozensets: Immutable versions of sets.

Named Tuples: Subclass of tuples with named fields, also immutable.

Bytes: Immutable sequences of byte data.

Numbers: Includes int, float, and complex types, which are immutable
